# Cute-interactive-message
This is just something I created from @jeyccarce "message" repository, by changing and upgrading a bit the code.
If you want to just see what happens you need to download all the files in the same folder and then execute the index.html one.
otherwise, if you want to try and edit the code I juggest you to use https://onecompiler.com/html/3x2zp2yd7, where you can edit all the files at the same time and see imeditely what happens to your interactive message.
