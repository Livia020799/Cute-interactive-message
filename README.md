# Cute-interactive-message
This is just something I created from @jeycaarce "message" repository, by changing and upgrading a bit the code. 

If you just want to see what happens you need to download all the files in the same folder (on your computer) and then execute the index.html one. 

Otherwise, if you want to try and edit the code, I suggest you to use https://onecompiler.com/html/3x2zp2yd7, where you can edit all the files at the same time and see imeditely what happens to your interactive message.
